# LASM (On Work)
Lime Assembler
This is a simple **32-bit x86 assembly** language written in **python 3.11.5**.
It supports all basic x86 instructions and some advanced instructions.
It also has a lot of features that make it easy to use, such as:

Note: I used Black Formatter for making code more Prettier.

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Error checking
* A built-in debugger

Code has 3 main codes:
    main.py (Main code.)
    variables.py (For variables and constants like colors and settings.)
    functions.py (Basic functions like toInt(x) for converting string to int.)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install Python 3.6 or later.
Once you have Python installed, you can clone the LASM repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/Duiccni/LASM.git
```

### Built-in Debugger

LASM has a built-in debugger that you can use to step through your code and inspect the values of variables.
This can be very helpful when you are trying to find a bug in your code.
