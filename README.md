# LASM (On Work)
Lime Assembler
A simple assembler created by Egemen YalÄ±n in Python 3.11.5 for my own coding language and operating system.

Code has 3 main codes:
    main.py (Main code.)
    variables.py (For variables and constants like colors and settings.)
    functions.py (Basic functions like toInt(x) for converting string to int.)
